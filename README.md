Statistical Arbitrage with Kalman FiltersA quantitative trading strategy that identifies mean-reversion opportunities between cointegrated assets (Pairs Trading). Unlike traditional approaches that use static linear regression, this project utilizes a Kalman Filter to dynamically estimate the hedge ratio ($\beta$) in real-time, allowing the model to adapt to structural market changes.🚀 OverviewStrategy: Statistical Arbitrage / Pairs TradingAsset Pair: Pepsi (PEP) and Coca-Cola (KO)Algorithm: Linear Kalman Filter for dynamic state estimationSignal Generation: Rolling Z-Score of the spreadPerformance: Backtested on 4 years of real market data (2020-2024)🧠 The Logic1. The Dynamic Hedge RatioStandard pairs trading assumes the relationship between two stocks is constant:$$Price_Y = \alpha + \beta \times Price_X + \epsilon$$In reality, this relationship drifts over time due to fundamental changes in the companies. This project uses a Kalman Filter to treat $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as "hidden states" that are updated with every new price observation.2. Signal Generation (Z-Score)We calculate the Spread between the actual price and the predicted "Fair Value":$$Spread = Price_{Actual} - (\alpha_{Kalman} + \beta_{Kalman} \times Price_{Reference})$$We then normalize this spread into a Z-Score using a 30-day rolling window to identify statistical anomalies:Z > 2.0: Asset is overvalued (Short Entry)Z < -2.0: Asset is undervalued (Long Entry)Z ~ 0: Spread has reverted to mean (Exit)🛠️ Tech StackPython: Core logic and simulationNumPy: Matrix multiplication and linear algebra for the Kalman FilterPandas: Time-series data manipulation and rolling window calculationsMatplotlib: Visualization of prices, hedge ratios, and equity curvesyfinance: Real-time market data API📂 Project StructurePlaintext/Alpha-Research-Kalman
